## MiniRt

MiniRT as for objectives to prove us that we are fluent in C. (It's the last project of the Common Core of 42 in C)

Maha and me made this project in 2 months, it was a crazy experience to make our own image from raycasting ! <br />
At the start we saw to tutorial about printing a sphere, then we made it ! Wooow :) <br/>

So at the end we handled everything below :

* Cones Cylinders Sphere Plane (Not triangle, surely for the real RT)

* Camera and Object Rotation Translation Resize

* Multi-Spot lights, colored

* Checkboard / Textures

* Reflection
